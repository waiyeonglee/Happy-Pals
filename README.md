#### Proudly presented to you by Team Ekspansyion

COVID-19 has affected every individualâ€™s everyday lifestyle in one way or the other including personal and professional life, mental wellbeing, interaction with families, social life, etc. Some statistics from the World Health Organisation <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/adolescent-mental-health">here</a> indicated that half of all mental health conditions start by 14 years of age but most cases are undetected and untreated. At the same time, depression is one of the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents globally.  

Focusing on the **Mental Health** issue, our team Ekspanyion, consisting of 3 members, *Philip Lee Hann Yung, Lee Wai Yeong* and *Lee Jinhen*, embarked on a journey of a lifetime to play our part in combating this issue by spurring our ideas via the SAP Cloud Track. Using PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, we have developed a web application that caters to the mental wellbeing of our users. Our app showcases many ways to release stress and find out more about your mental health. The integrated chatbot within our web app is developed using SAP's proprietary Conversational AI platform.

Several one-of-its-kind features have been implemented into this web application. These features include imagery meditation, soothing music playlist, fun destressing videos and videos for laughs! Users will find themselves immersed in a sanctuary of calmness. Everybody needs a rest from time to time. To enhance engagement with users, there is a point-based in-game reward system, in which users can exchange accumulated points for a cute plushie.

## Technical Implementation

Web Application
- The web app is built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP to handle special interactions with the use.
- It was then deployed on Google Cloud Platform's Compute App Engine to be hosted as a Apache server.
- The MySQL instance on Google Cloud Platform did not interface well with GCP's Compute App Enginer so we ended up using FreeMySQLhosting.net to host the MySQL server.
- Login credentials are stored in their hashed form to ensure that the individual is non-traceable.

AI Chatbot
- The chatbot was build on SAP Cloud using SAP's Conversational AI toolbox. Custom messages were used to train the chatbot so that the chatbot knows to react to emotional keywords and common conversational keywords.
- The bot was trained using various intents and organized the logic behind the bot's responses and a fallback scenario in which the bot is unable to decipher the user's prompt.
- The log feed is utilized to improvise the AI, to improve it accuracy in predicting intent and thus the correct response.
- AI bot integrated onto website via Webchat.
